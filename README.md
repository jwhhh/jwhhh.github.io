# Jw's Site

[![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/jwhhh/jwhhh.github.io/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://github.com/jwhhh/jwhhh.github.io/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

This is a site holder for my own notes/thoughts on the learning path.

The site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [TeXt theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme).

Check it out [here](https://jwhhh.github.io)!
