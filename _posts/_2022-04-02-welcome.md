You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

# Formula Test

When $$a \ne 0$$, there are two solutions to $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$ and they are

$$x_1 = {-b + \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

$$x_2 = {-b - \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \notag$$

$$\frac{1}{2}$$

# Subtitle 1
Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

# Subtitle 2
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
